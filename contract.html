        <p>•damentals 2019 web110_01 Course Contract with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen</p>.
<p>•I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
<p>•I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
